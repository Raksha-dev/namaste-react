Episode 12- redux--

Redux and React are different different libraries. and redux is not mandatory use only when required like application is huge may be.
Redux primarily used to handle states of the applications, and easy to debug.

What is redux store??

Redux store is a big global object which will be kept at global central place, which can be accessed by any component and can be read and write.

|---------|
|         |
|         |
|         |  Redux store
|         |
|         |
|---------|

But to manage that big data under the global object we have slices, store can have as many slice we want, Redux Slice can be a user slice, cart slice,
can be theme slice, cart slice can not be directly modified.

Here we are taking an example of cart.

|---------|
|User slice|
|---------|
|  cart   |  Redux store
|---------|
|slice    |
|---------|

Redux slice can not be directly modified, so to modify the slice below things happens.

Once Add button is clicked, so it will not directly modifies the cart, but it will disptach an action, and calls the funtion(), and this function modifies the cart.
and this function known as Reducer.

** When add Button is clicked, it disptaches an action, which calls Reducer(function), and this Reducer updates the slice of the redux store.

++ Now to read data from an updated cart slice so that cart component will be updated with the items, cart will be subscribe to the store using Selector.
Selector is known an subscribing to the store

Homework?

onClick={handleClick} - passing a function
onClick={handleClick(items)} - calling a function rightway
onClick={() => handleClick(items)} - call back function


** do not subscribe to the full store, subscribe only specific part of the store which is needed. this is very efficient.
** Reducer word will be used only when we are creating store, and Reducers will be used for slices.
** Vanilla redux(older-redux) was not allowed us to MUTATE the state, in this case create new state and return that new state.
but with the RTK, u have to modify the state.
** RTK uses Immer behind the scene
