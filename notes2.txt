* useEffect=
- useEffect(); is a function which takes 2 parameter, one is call back function and the another one is dependency array.
useEffect(() => {})
- if useEffect is empty(without any dependency[]) then it will called everytime after the component is rendered
- if empty dependency [] is there then the useEffect only will be called on intial(only once)
- if there is some dependency then once that dependency changes then only the useEffect will be rendered.


* Router-

- To create browser Router we have to import an configuration from react router dom, which is createBrowserRouter, and it takes a configuration, as an array of object
- To render this configuration, will require one more component called RouterProvider

useErrorRouter - this hook is used to check if error is api/network or types of errors/

* If header and footer need to be there and with only children the page will change so we have to send all the child pages as children, and using Outlet component
it will get all the configuration and render it on the page.

* There is 2 types of routing

- Server side routing - when we can get an .html page or make network call, so page refreshes, that is called Server side routing.
- Client side routing - In this case component are loaded already on the page, and it does not refreshes the page.

* if we want to send the path as dynamic routing, then path will come : (path: "/restaurant/:id")
